# Mini-Torrent
The Mini-torrent project is basically a peer-to-peer file sharing network. The user has functionalities like sharing a file, downloading a file, removing a file from sharing etc. It is basically like the Bit-Torrent we have on the internet.

The architecture is such that there are multiple clients(users) and a tracker which stores the metadata of which all users have a file, basically a file-user mapping.
